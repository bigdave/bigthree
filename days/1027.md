It's definitely a "The Bosses Upstairs Are Pissed" type of day. Celebrate with
one of the greatest episodes of The Big Three. Don receives a new Mercedes from
a generous female acquaintance, and Perry rips everyone off by stealing a laptop
and blaming everyone else for him being poor. When Don reads a letter from a
disgruntled man whose look Perry has stolen, he breaks down in tears. Mole,
with the composure of a true professional, takes the letter from him and
continues the brutal affront.

<pre>Don: Why don't you put any picture of Cricket online? You put all those picture up of that fucking car wreck online... which some people now are claiming isn't real...</pre>

<pre>Mole: But Scaremaster, you've been with guys before...
Perry: Na-ever...
Don: Mole, hold on n... well, Perry, you can't say "never"</pre>
