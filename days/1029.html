resistance to having the word 'Breast' written on his forehead.<a role="clip">1:21</a></p>

<h4>Moleplay</h4>
<p>Perry goes on a date with Linda Johnson, the February 1987 Penthouse Pet, who he

<h4>Perry's Corner</h4>
<p>Featuring some of the best background music ever during an episode of Perry's
Corner, the segment is completely awful, as always, because of Perry. He talks
about having Snookie flown to him so that they can be lovers, and accuses Johnny
Knoxville of owing him $10,000,000.<a role="clip">32:00</a></p>
