<p>By the blessings of Dog, this is, without question, the greatest Big Three

<p>Ideally, Contracts should be listened to daily, during periods of calming focus
and meditation.</p>

Perry: No no no, there's no - did I say 'threat'?
Hank Greenberg: You said 'A threat to be a man now'.
Perry: Ok, oh - I'm sorry.</pre>
