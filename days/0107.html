<p>Our episode begins with the wonderful Mary Jane explaining that the podcast
is still on hiatus due to Perry's unprofessional behavior.</p>
<p>Perry's attempt at apologizing includes him asking Don for a loan<a role="clip">1:38</a> and asking to park at The Comedy Store<a role="clip">17:41</a>.</p>
