Featuring guest star Andy Dick, this is a very sexual episode of The Big Three.
Perry starts things off by stating that he will do gay porn for double his
standard rate.<a role="clip">9:18</a>

Andy Dick shows up to advocate for gay rights, and end gay bashing and gay
hazing, and gives silver ribbons to The Big Three to wear for the cause.

Perry's Corner is awful as he proceeds to insult a child singer, complains about
authority figures, and suggests that they should do porn.

<h4>Moleplay</h4>
Perry demonstrates his lack of acting ability as he fails to portray both
himself, and Randy Callahan during the H.J./B.J. suckfest they had in 1992.
