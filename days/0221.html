<p>Take a step off of the beaten path today and check out The 100th Podcast on Simply Don the Podcast. To celebrate, we have an incredible recording of Perry as he tries to get his Facebook account back under control, courtesy of Hugh A. Craig</p>

<p>Perry starts out with a rant about how Catholics have been "poisoned by the devil" and why his religion is better than both theirs, and Medieval Times restaurants.<a role="clip">4:47</a></p>

<pre><a role="clip">5:19</a>Tom: Would you say that everyone that is not a Jehova's Witness is a Satan worshiper?
Perry: You got it!
</pre>

<p>The meat of this episode comes from Perry reading comments on his Facebook page. Apparently his account was hacked for the 810th time, and Tom explains that he needs to have Perry voice-verify in order to unlock it and get Facebook to punish those who have defaced his page.<a role="clip">8:52</a></p>

<p>Once Perry starts reading, he discovers that in his absence, Mole has decided to have a party at his place to celebrate his Javaho baptism, and all the dogs are invited!<a role="clip">10:37</a> Unfortunately Perry lets everyone down by canceling the party, the dog parade, and the all-male nude contest.</p>

<p>While this episode has a lot of Perry talking and acting unprofessionally, it's still a gem. Some high points:</p>

<pre><a role="clip">19:05</a>Perry (reading): Eric Brubaker: Congrats Perry, loyalty and obedience to Jehova God are the most important things in this world. You've always worshiped the bone. I'm glad the Javahos have finally made your love of dog official.
Perry: Oh my god - he's being blocked.
Perry (reading): David Savage writes, proud of you Perry, you can now jerk off a dog without anybody judging you besides the holy dog himself.
Perry: Oh you're being blocked. You're being blocked. Period.
</pre>

<pre><a role="clip">42:25</a>Perry (reading): Will there be a Randy Callahan pi√±ata filled with all your fake disability cash?
Perry: Ah - loser. Mother fucking loser! Fake?! [unintelligible and unprofessional yelling]
Top: You alright?
Perry: No!
</pre>

<pre><a role="clip">57:24</a>Perry (reading): Leonard Gulch: Judging by the number of responses to this exciting news you have clearly touched more people than the elders or the law will ever know. Congratulations, Perry.
Perry: Thank you, Leonard.
