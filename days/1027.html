one of the greatest episodes of The Big Three. Perry appologizes for biting Don,
but refuses to apologize for punching Mole in the face. <a role="clip">7:45</a>

Includes a rousing Moleplay where The Scaremaster plays Captain Leslie Nielson
in a Poseidon Adventure type scenario where he explores his sexuality. <a role="clip">1:00:05</a>
