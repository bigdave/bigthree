A coleague once approached me, a learned man, and inquired: As it was the sabbath before Martin Luther King day, what 'The Big Three Podcast' episode was most appropriate to listen to? Of course common practice would be to listen to 'The New Big 3', from The Ace Days. However, it did occur to me that not every person may be appropriately knowledgeable to make these decisions in life, and for them to seek help is not an admission of guilt, but an opportunity for two or more individuals to share in knowledge of The Big Three. A solution needed to be developed.
